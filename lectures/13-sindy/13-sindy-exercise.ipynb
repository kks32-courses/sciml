    "## Main ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "SINDy aims to learn nonlinear dynamical systems from data. Suppose we have a set of measurements $u(t)\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ from some physical system at different points in time $t$. SINDy seeks to represent the time evolution of $u(t)$ in terms of a nonlinear function $f$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d}{dt}u(t) = f(x(t)). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation constitutes a *dynamical system* for the measurements $u(t)$. The vector $u(t)=[u_1(t), u_2(t), \\dots u_n(t)]^\\top$ gives the state of the physical system at time $t$. The function $f(u(t))$ constrains how the system evolves in time. \n",
    "\n",
    "We suppose that $f(u(t))$ is a weighted sum of nonlinear terms, and our goal is to discover which terms make up $f$, and their corresponding weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind SINDy is that the function $f$ is often **sparse** in the space (with few terms) of an appropriate set of basis functions, and we can find its terms by enforcing sparsity while performing linear regression. It’s a simple and powerful idea, which we’ll explore in detail. For example, the function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\t\\frac{d}{dt}u = f(u)\n",
    "\t= \\begin{bmatrix} f_1(u)\\\\f_2(u) \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\t= \\begin{bmatrix}1 - u_1 + 3u_1u_2 \\\\ u_2^2 - 5u_1^3 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is sparse with respect to the set of polynomials of two variables in the sense that if we were to write an expansion of the component functions of $f$ in this basis (e.g. $f_{1}(u) = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty\\sum_{j=0}^\\infty a_{i,j}u_1^iu_2^j$), only a small number of coefficients ($a_{i,j}$) would be nonzero.\n",
    "\n",
    "SINDy employs **sparse regression** to find a linear combination of basis functions that best capture the dynamic behavior of the physical system."

    "## Linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll take a brief look at linear regression in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of linear regression is to model the relationship between two variables, an $n$-dimensional independent variable and a scalar-valued dependent variable, using a linear equation to relate the two. In machine learning, typically, the $n$-dimensional independent variable consists of the data point’s features, and the scalar-valued dependent variable holds the corresponding target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at the equation that describes the linear relationship that we would like to establish between these two variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = b + X \\omega$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll assume that we have $m$ data points, each with $n$ features, forming the $m \\times n$ matrix $X$. We also have a vector $y$ of size $m \\times 1$ containing a target associated with each data point. In general, it's impossible to satisfy the above equation exactly. Instead, our goal is to find coefficents for the weight vector $w$ and bias $b$ such that the right-hand-side of the equation (let's call that $\\hat{y}$) comes as close as possible to the target $y$. Here, the weight vector $w$ has a size $n \\times 1$, the bias vector $b$ is of size $m \\times 1$ where the constant bias is repeated $m$ times. \n",
    "\n",
    "Visually, if our data points have just one feature (so $X$ has one column), we can think of linear regression as finding a line in 2D that comes closest to passing through all the points $(x_i, y_i)$, where $x_i$ is a row of $X$, and $y_i$ corresponds to the target value. In the diagram below, the orange dots show the target values $y$, and the gray dots show the predictions $\\hat{y}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![regression](regression.png)"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "If our data points were two-dimensional, then we would be finding a plane instead of a line. And if they were $n$-dimensional, we would be finding a hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of machine learning, it’s common to write the relationship between $X$ and $y$ by incorporating $b$ into the rest of the equation, which avoids the repetition of the constant bias:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = X \\xi$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, $X$ now has size $m \\times (n+1)$, where the entries in the first column are all 1. The unknown vector is now $\\xi$, of size $(n + 1) \\times 1$, because it contains the value of the constant bias in the first row followed by the values of $w$. The vector $y$ has the same size as before, $m \\times 1$, as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the equation above, the target values $y$ and the features $X$ are known, so our goal is to find the vector $\\xi$ that makes the right-hand-side of the equation best approximate the left-hand-side. Problems of this kind are often solved directly using least-squares techniques (like the normal equation), which aim to minimize the square of the distance between the predicted values $\\hat{y}$ and target values $y$ — in other words, they minimize the sum of the lengths of the vertical lines in the diagram above. Problems of this kind can also be solved using iterative optimization methods, such as gradient descent, which grant us more freedom in our approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often our goal is not just to get the best $\\xi$ — we want the best $\\xi$ that is also sparse. Sparsity is a desirable feature in general, and we’ll see later why sparsity is super important in the SINDy scenario in particular. It turns out that there are also several algorithms that help us solve the equation above with sparsity — for example, LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a popular method."

    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dt}u(t)=f(u(t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have samples of $u(t)$ at several times, and nothing else. But if we have $u(t)$, we can easily calculate $\\frac{d}{dt}u(t)$ using a numerical method (such as finite differences, or total variation with regularization, as suggested by the authors in the paper). Our goal then is to find the function $f$ that best represents the behavior of the derivative of $u(t)$ over time. One way to represent $f$ is by thinking of it as a linear combination of a set of candidate functions. These candidate functions can be polynomial functions, trigonometric functions, or anything else that might be a reasonable guess for the behavior of the derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if someone else gives us data that was generated by the Lorenz system without telling us how it was generated, we would be successful in discovering the equations as long as we include low-degree polynomials in our set of candidate functions. That’s because the Lorenz system looks like this:\n",
