    "# Modes of Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiation is a fundamental operation in calculus, with various applications in the fields of science, engineering, and beyond. Depending on the context and requirements, different methods or \"modes\" of differentiation can be employed. Below are the primary modes of differentiation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Modes of differentiation](differentiation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Symbolic Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Symbolic differentiation is the process of finding the derivative of an expression using the rules of calculus, exactly as one might do by hand. It works on symbolic representations of functions, employing rules like the power rule, chain rule, and product rule, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "- Provides exact, closed-form expressions for derivatives.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "- Can lead to expression swell, where the resulting expressions become very large.\n",
    "- Not always feasible for complex functions or when the symbolic form isn't known.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Automatic Differentiation (AD)\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation computes the derivative of a function as it is being evaluated. AD is neither symbolic nor numerical differentiation but utilizes the underlying computational graph and dual numbers to obtain exact derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "- Provides exact derivatives.\n",
    "- Well-suited for complex functions where symbolic differentiation would be cumbersome.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "- Requires specialized software or libraries.\n",
    "- Can be computationally intensive for large functions or systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of AD:\n",
    "- **Forward Mode**: Efficient when the number of inputs is smaller than the number of outputs.\n",
    "- **Reverse Mode**: Efficient when the number of outputs is smaller than the number of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Numerical Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical differentiation estimates derivatives using finite differences. For example, the central difference method approximates the derivative as:\n",
    "$$ f'(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x - h)}{2h} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "- Simple to implement.\n",
    "- Doesn't require the symbolic form of the function.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "- Prone to rounding errors, especially for small $h$.\n",
    "- Less accurate compared to symbolic or AD methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Manual Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the process of computing the derivative by hand, using one's understanding of calculus rules. Once derived, the resulting expression can be coded directly into software.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "- Allows for optimization and simplification while deriving.\n",
    "- No need for external libraries or tools.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "- Error-prone and time-consuming.\n",
    "- Not scalable for complex or large functions."

    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Automatic Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation, often abbreviated as AD, is a set of techniques to compute derivatives of functions specified by computer programs. Unlike symbolic differentiation, which operates on symbolic representations of functions, and numerical differentiation, which uses finite difference methods, AD computes exact derivatives by executing the given program and is not plagued by numerical instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dual Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Dual numbers form the foundation for forward mode automatic differentiation. A dual number is expressed as:\n",
    "$$ z = a + b \\epsilon $$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ a $ is the real part.\n",
    "- $ b $ is the dual part.\n",
    "- $ \\epsilon $ is the dual unit with the property $ \\epsilon^2 = 0 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "With dual numbers, for a function $ f(x) $, evaluating $ f(x + \\epsilon) $ provides:\n",
    "$$ f(x) + f'(x)\\epsilon $$\n",
    "This encapsulates both the function's value and its derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, to differentiate $ f(x) = x^2 $ using dual numbers:\n",
    "$$ f(x + \\epsilon) = (x + \\epsilon)^2 = x^2 + 2x\\epsilon + \\epsilon^2 = x^2 + 2x\\epsilon $$\n",
    "The coefficient of $ \\epsilon $ represents the derivative, $ 2x $.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph-based Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph-based differentiation, often linked to reverse-mode automatic differentiation, is popularized by deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Computation Graphs**: Functions, made up of basic operations, can be visualized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In this graph, nodes denote variables or operations, and edges highlight dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Forward Pass**: This phase involves computing the function from input to output, populating the graph's nodes with intermediate values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Backward Pass**: Using the chain rule of calculus, derivatives are computed in reverse, from output to input. This 'reverse' phase computes gradients for each node, accumulating gradients as it traverses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Differences between Dual Numbers and Graph-based Differentiation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mode**: Dual numbers are suited for forward mode AD, where derivatives with respect to each input variable are calculated sequentially. Graph-based differentiation, prominent in deep learning, generally employs reverse mode AD, determining the derivative with respect to all input variables simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency for Different Functions**: Forward mode (dual numbers) excels in functions where the number of inputs is dwarfed by the number of outputs (like parameter estimation). Conversely, reverse mode (graph-based) shines when there are fewer outputs than inputs, a scenario familiar in deep learning with numerous parameters and a scalar loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implementation**: Dual numbers expand on number concepts and arithmetic operations, whereas graph-based differentiation often demands a more intricate framework to assemble and navigate the computation graph.\n"

    "# Forward and Reverse Mode Automatic Differentiation (AD) \n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation (AD) is a powerful technique for obtaining exact derivatives of functions, without the challenges associated with symbolic or numerical differentiation. AD can be broken down into two primary modes: forward mode and reverse mode. Using the function \n",

    "as an example, let's delve into these two modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Forward Mode AD\n",
    "\n",
    "In forward mode AD, we differentiate with respect to one input variable at a time. This means that for a function with `n` inputs, we'd perform `n` forward passes to obtain all the partial derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's compute the derivatives with respect to $x_1$ and $x_2$ for our function.\n",

    "> Break the function into elementary operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Derivative with respect to $x_1$:\n",
    "Starting with a seed value $\\dot{x}_1 = 1$ and $\\dot{x}_2 = 0$ (indicating we're differentiating with respect to $x_1$):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute $\\dot{x}_1^2$: Using the rule $(x^2)' = 2x$, we get \n",
    "$$ \\dot{x}_1^2 = 2x_1 \\cdot \\dot{x}_1 = 2x_1 $$\n",

    "## 2. Reverse Mode AD\n",
    "\n",
    "In reverse mode AD, the calculations propagate from the output backwards to the inputs. This means that for a function with `n` outputs, we'd perform `n` backward passes to get all the derivatives. It's particularly efficient when `n` is small, which is why it's popular in deep learning where we usually compute derivatives of a scalar loss.\n",
    "\n",

    "> Use chain rule to calculate gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "![Chain rule AD](ad7.png)\n",
    "> Use chain rule to calculate gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do a forward pass to compute the function value:\n",
    "$$ y = x_1^2 + x_2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Start the backward pass with a seed $\\dot{y} = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For the term $x_1^2$:\n",
    "Using the chain rule, \n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_1} = 2x_1 \\cdot \\dot{y} = 2x_1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For the term $x_2$:\n",
    "Again, using the chain rule, \n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_2} = \\dot{y} = 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both forward and reverse mode AD have their strengths. The choice between them depends on the relationship between the number of inputs and outputs for a function. For our simple example, both methods yield the same results, but their computational efficiency would differ for functions with many more inputs or outputs.\n"

    "# 1D Full Waveform Inversion (FWI)\n",
    "\n",
    "Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is an advanced seismic inversion method used to estimate subsurface parameters by minimizing the difference between observed and modeled data. In this document, we'll explore the basics of 1D FWI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "FWI aims to iteratively refine a model of the subsurface until synthetic seismograms generated from the model closely match the observed field data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the difference between observed $d_{obs}$ and modeled $d_{cal}$ data, an objective function $J$ is employed, which is usually the L2 norm of their difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J(m) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int (d_{obs}(t) - d_{cal}(m, t))^2 dt$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $m$ represents the subsurface model parameters (like velocity).\n",
    "- $t$ is the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of FWI is to minimize this objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient Descent:\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize $J$, we typically use a gradient-based optimization method. The gradient of $J$ with respect to the model parameters is computed, which indicates the direction in which $m$ should be updated to decrease $J$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adjoint Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "One efficient method for computing the gradient involves the adjoint state technique. Here's a basic outline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forward modeling**: Solve the wave equation using the current model $m$ to get $d_{cal}$.\n",
    "2. **Data residual**: Compute the difference between $d_{cal}$ and $d_{obs}$.\n",
    "3. **Adjoint modeling**: Using the data residual as a source, solve the wave equation backward in time.\n",
    "4. **Compute the gradient**: The gradient is then computed using the forward and adjoint wavefields.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Update:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the gradient is known, the model is updated using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m_{new} = m_{old} - \\alpha \\times \\nabla J$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\alpha$ is a step length or learning rate.\n",
    "- $\\nabla J$ is the gradient of the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Repeat:\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is iteratively repeated until the objective function converges to a minimum value or other stopping criteria are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regularization and Challenge:\n",
    "\n",
    "FWI is highly non-linear and can be sensitive to noise, initial model inaccuracies, and local minima. Regularization techniques, multi-scale inversions (starting with low frequencies), and good initial models can help in achieving robust and reliable inversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1D FWI provides an avenue for estimating subsurface properties by iteratively updating a model to best match observed data. Though powerful, it requires careful setup and handling to ensure accurate and meaningful results.\n"

Given a difference in gradients $s_k = \\nabla f(x_{k+1}) - \\nabla f(x_k)$ and a difference in steps $y_k = x_{k+1} - x_k$, the BFGS update for the inverse Hessian approximation $H_{k+1}$ is:\n",

    "   - BFGS is a quasi-Newton method that builds an approximation of the inverse Hessian to guide its search.\n",
    "   - Adam is a first-order method with adaptive learning rates for each parameter, based on moving averages of the gradient and squared gradient.\n",

    "   - BFGS requires storing the inverse Hessian approximation, which can be memory-intensive for large problems (though L-BFGS mitigates this).\n",
    "   - Adam's memory usage is relatively low since it only maintains moving averages of the gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Convergence**:\n",
    "   - BFGS generally has superlinear convergence, meaning it can converge faster than gradient-based methods on some problems.\n",
    "   - Adam is known for its robustness and often works well even when hyperparameters are not finely tuned. However, its convergence properties are not as strong theoretically as BFGS.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Usage**:\n",
    "   - BFGS is often preferred for medium-sized optimization problems, especially when function evaluations are expensive or the function landscape is complex.\n",
    "   - Adam is predominantly used in deep learning due to its efficiency and robustness on large-scale problems.\n",
