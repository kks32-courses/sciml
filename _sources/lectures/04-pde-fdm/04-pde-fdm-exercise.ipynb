    "A PDE is an equation which involves an unknown function (or functions) of multiple variables and its (or their) partial derivatives. A PDE is \"partial\" because it contains partial derivatives (derivatives with respect to one of several variables) rather than just ordinary derivatives.\n",

    "$$F(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, u, u_{x_1}, u_{x_2}, ..., u_{x_n}, u_{x_1x_1}, ..., u_{x_nx_n}, ...) = 0$$\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the classical PDEs in physics is the 1D heat equation, which describes the distribution of heat in a given region over time. It is a second-order linear parabolic PDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 1D rod, the heat equation is given by:\n",

    "$$\\frac{\\partial u(x, t)}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 u(x, t)}{\\partial x^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ u(x, t) $ represents the temperature at position $ x $ and time $ t $.\n",
    "- $ \\alpha $ is the thermal diffusivity of the material of the rod, a positive constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heat equation states that the rate of change of temperature in time ($ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} $) at any point in the rod is proportional to the curvature of the temperature profile at that point ($ \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} $). This curvature represents how the temperature gradient changes spatially.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully solve this PDE, boundary conditions (e.g., fixed temperature at the ends of the rod) and initial conditions (e.g., initial temperature distribution) would also be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical differentiation methods are essential in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) like the heat equation. The primary idea is to discretize the derivatives, replacing them with finite differences that can be evaluated at grid points in space and time. Below, I'll discuss how to approach the 1D heat equation using numerical differentiation techniques, particularly the finite difference method.\n",

    "Heat transfer is a fundamental phenomenon that occurs in various engineering processes. While 1D heat transfer problems provide a foundational understanding, most practical scenarios involve multi-dimensional heat conduction. For this reason, understanding the behavior of heat transfer in two or more dimensions becomes crucial for many engineering applications.\n",

    "In this section, we delve into the 2D heat conduction problem. It's important to note that while the concepts of heat conduction remain the same in two dimensions, the mathematical representation becomes more involved. We will examine the governing differential equation that models this process, known as the 2D heat equation. This equation describes the distribution of temperature within a 2D domain as it evolves over time, taking into account the material's thermal diffusivity.\n",
