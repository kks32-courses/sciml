    "\n",
    "In standard probabilistic modeling practice, we represent our beliefs over unknown continuous quantities with simple parametric distributions like the normal, exponential, and Laplacian distributions. However, using such simple forms, which are commonly symmetric and unimodal (or have a fixed number of modes when we take a mixture of them), restricts the performance and flexibility of our methods. For instance, standard variational inference in the Variational Autoencoder uses independent univariate normal distributions to represent the variational family. The true posterior is neither independent nor normally distributed, which results in suboptimal inference and simplifies the model that is learnt. In other scenarios, we are likewise restricted by not being able to model multimodal distributions and heavy or light tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalizing Flows \\[1-4\\] are a family of methods for constructing flexible learnable probability distributions, often with neural networks, which allow us to surpass the limitations of simple parametric forms. Pyro contains state-of-the-art normalizing flow implementations, and this tutorial explains how you can use this library for learning complex models and performing flexible variational inference. We introduce the main idea of Normalizing Flows (NFs) and demonstrate learning simple univariate distributions with element-wise, multivariate, and conditional flows."

    "Normalizing Flows are a family of methods for constructing flexible distributions. Let's first restrict our attention to representing univariate distributions. The basic idea is that a simple source of noise, for example a variable with a standard normal distribution, $X\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, is passed through a bijective (i.e. invertible) function, $g(\\cdot)$ to produce a more complex transformed variable $Y=g(X)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given random variable, we typically want to perform two operations: sampling and scoring. Sampling $Y$ is trivial. First, we sample $X=x$, then calculate $y=g(x)$. Scoring $Y$, or rather, evaluating the log-density $\\log(p_Y(y))$, is more involved. How does the density of $Y$ relate to the density of $X$? We can use the substitution rule of integral calculus to answer this. Suppose we want to evaluate the expectation of some function of $X$. Then,\n",

    "If $g$ is cleverly constructed (and we will see several examples shortly), we can produce distributions that are more complex than standard normal noise and yet have easy sampling and computationally tractable scoring. Moreover, we can compose such bijective transformations to produce even more complex distributions. By an inductive argument, if we have $L$ transforms $g_{(0)}, g_{(1)},\\ldots,g_{(L-1)}$, then the log-density of the transformed variable $Y=(g_{(0)}\\circ g_{(1)}\\circ\\cdots\\circ g_{(L-1)})(X)$ is\n",

The field of Normalizing Flows aims to construct such $g$ for multivariate $X$ to transform simple i.i.d. standard normal noise into complex, learnable, high-dimensional distributions. The methods have been applied to such diverse applications as image modeling, text-to-speech, unsupervised language induction, data compression, and modeling molecular structures. As probability distributions are the most fundamental component of probabilistic modeling we will likely see many more exciting state-of-the-art applications in the near future."

A coupling transform \\[8, 9\\] divides the input variable into two parts and applies an element-wise bijection to the section half whose parameters are a function of the first. Optionally, an element-wise bijection is also applied to the first half. Dividing the inputs at $d$, the transform is,\n",

As shown in the references, when we combine a sequence of coupling layers sandwiched between random permutations so we introduce dependencies between all dimensions, we can model complex multivariate distributions.\n",

    "Most of the learnable transforms in Pyro have a corresponding helper function that takes care of constructing a neural network for the transform with the correct output shape. This neural network outputs the parameters of the transform and is known as a [hypernetwork](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09106) \\[10\\]. The helper functions are represented by lower-case versions of the corresponding class name, and usually input at the very least the input-dimension or shape of the distribution to model.
